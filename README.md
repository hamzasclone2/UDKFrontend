# UDKFrontend
Frontend for UDK Senior Design Project

The easiest way to run this is with expo. Follow these instructions here if you haven't already:  
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started    
This github project doesn't have everything that would be in a normal expo project so replace your local App.js with this one and get any extra files from the assets folder as needed.  
Also make sure that you do the following command inside the project folder before you run this for the first time.  
```
npm install --save react-navigation
```   
After you've done that, open the expo project and run it on either ios directly or on android after opening the android studio simulator.  

The app is reading atricles form API server. The server's IP address and port configuration are in api.js file (in case of server change, the configuration needs to be changed)
