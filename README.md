# UDKFrontend
Frontend for UDK Senior Design Project

The easiest way to run this is with expo.  
Follow these instructions here if you haven't already: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started  
This github doesn't have everything that would be in a normal expo project so replace your App.js with this one and get any extra files from the assets folder as needed.    
After you've done that, open the expo project and run it on either ios directly or on android after opening the android studio simulator.
